# Verifying Signature API Solana 
API for verifying the user's signature from Solana Crypto wallet

## Name
SolPress Solana Login Plugin app that assists with verification of wallet signin.

## Usage
This Node.js Express app can be run on heroku or hosting of your choice and paired with the WordPress Plugin here - https://github.com/solpressplugins/solpress-login-plugin - and that allows a full independent verification server for Solana wallet registration and login.

## Support
For assistance you can find our documentation, social media links and more at https://solpress.dev

## Roadmap
We would like to eventually add NFT gating and more features to the register/login plugin and this related app.

## Contributing
We are open to contributions! 

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
